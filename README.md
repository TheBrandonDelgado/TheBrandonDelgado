I’m a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer who thrives on creating products that users can fall in love with. At Sazmining, I pioneered the industry’s first Bitcoin Mining as a Service platform integrated with the OCEAN decentralized mining pool, delivering real-time transparency and non-custodial payouts using TypeScript, Supabase, and React. I design scalable systems, automate financial workflows with Node.js microservices, and lead teams to elevate engineering standards while mentoring others. I’m driven by a vision to build products that not only solve problems but also spark joy and advance human potential.
