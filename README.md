# Welcome!

My name is Brandon Delgado and I'm a software engineer.

I'm certified in Front End Engineering with frameworks and tools like React, Redux, JavaScript and TypeScript. I'm currently working on becoming certified in Full Stack Engineering with frameworks like Express.js and Node.js so that I can independently build apps from start to finish. I freelance and work full-time. At all times I make sure to be building something new, challenging and exciting.

I'm always open to new opportunities so feel free to email me at TheBrandonDelgado@gmail.com.

My favorite personal projects are pinned below. Thanks for visiting
